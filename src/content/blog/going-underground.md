### Something's Happening Here Today

The biggest improvement is that now you can go into the levels inside the sky island. Currently they're made with the cellular automata builder from Malwoden. I like how it looks, but the results are not very reliable. Sometimes I get a completely open island, sometimes I get nothing but corridors. I'll have to go deeper on this.

### Other Improvements

- Basic bump combat! Smash your foes to bits with your body!
- Better AI! Rats are afraid of everything else, so they run away. A new monster, the ooze, just wants to kill.
- Bloodstains when something dies
- A game log, so you can tell what's happening
- Explore mode, where you can pan around the map and see information.
- A sort of auto-explore (you have to hold down O to auto-explore for now, need to work out how to get the player to do mutltple actions)

### To Do

- Random names
- Items/Equipment
- Mouse support
