### Altars and Gifts

The Ageless now inhabit the land, in the form of altars. You can now kneel at these altars and sacrifice something precious, receiving a piece of their power in return (perhaps). This is, of course, meant to be a large portion of the game, and has a lot of other systems tied into it, so it has taken quite a bit. Status effects, activated abilities, as well as a lot of UI work.

### Other Improvements

- Keyboard support for items and equipment
- Experience and leveling (though there's still a lot more to do here)
- Enemies and items on all levels, and spawning based on depth
- Autoattacking
- An action bar at the bottom, sort of reminiscent of Caves of Qud
- Ability to choose what items to pick up if multiple are in a tile

### To Do

- Travel to other islands
- Possible rework of entities to have race/challenge level/class?
- Ranged combat
