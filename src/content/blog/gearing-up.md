### Stats and Equipment

The main thing this time around is a deeper stat system and equipment. Previously, a melee attack was simply one damage. Now, you have multiple equipment slots, which can let you do more damage or protect yourself. Also, combat is now based on stats and randomness, allowing for misses or hits for no damage. Now that slots are implemented, mutations like multiple arms can eventually be added.

### Other Improvements

- Random name generator: Now you have a name!
- Mouse support: Almost everything should be mouse accessible in some fashion (and currently some things like equipping items are only able to be done via mouse)
- Better autoexplore! We're halfway to our DCSS O-Tab life.
- Different font: I think it's a little more legible.

### To Do

- Keyboard support for items/equipment
- Spawn enemies and items based on level (and spawn on more than just the first level)
- Experience and leveling
- Items that effect you in some deeper way than just DV/DR/Damage
- Ageless and mutations
